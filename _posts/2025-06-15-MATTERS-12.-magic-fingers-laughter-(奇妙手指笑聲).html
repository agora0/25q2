<h2>12. Magic Fingers Laughter (奇妙手指笑聲)</h2><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/c9d6b6e2-bc31-4b4d-a875-c61e725bdce0.png/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>12.

Magic Fingers Laughter</h2><p>Yoga class notes: 40 Foundation Exercises</p><p>One day in Laughter Yoga class, I learned a movement called "Magic Laughter." The teacher showed us to hold up both index fingers, and while saying "Aaaay," move the two fingers together and apart three times. On the third time, turn one hand into a "peace" sign while laughing. Then do it again to make two "peace" signs! Finally, extend four fingers on both hands for the last repetition.</p><p>When doing this movement, I suddenly felt very familiar, as if I had seen a similar movement somewhere before, but I couldn't remember where. I didn't think this movement was childish at all, but found it very interesting and immediately liked it. While doing it, my mood also became cheerful, and I really felt very happy! It felt like going back to childhood, carefree. This "Magic Laughter" really has magic, making me laugh uncontrollably!</p><h2><br class="smart">12. 奇妙手指笑聲</h2><p>瑜珈課筆記：40個基礎練習</p><p>某日上大笑瑜珈課，學到一個叫做「奇妙大笑」的動作。老師教我們舉起兩根食指，然後一邊說「Aaaay」，一邊讓兩根手指靠近又分開，重複三次。第三次的時候，把其中一隻手變成「YA」的手勢，同時大笑。接著再做一次，變成兩個「YA」！最後一次，兩隻手都伸出四根手指。</p><p>做這個動作的時候，我突然覺得好熟悉，好像在哪裡看過類似的動作，但一時又想不起來。我一點也不覺得這個動作很幼稚，反而覺得很有趣，馬上就喜歡上了。一邊做，心情也跟著愉快起來，真的覺得很開心！好像回到小時候，無憂無慮的感覺。這個「奇妙大笑」真的有魔法，讓我忍不住一直笑！</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.laughteryoga.org/">www.laughteryoga.org...</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://laugh-yoga-hk.blogspot.com/">laugh-yoga-hk.blogsp...</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.tonkabean.me/">www.tonkabean.me/</a></p><p>Tonkabean</p><p>2025 June</p><p><br class="smart"></p>
