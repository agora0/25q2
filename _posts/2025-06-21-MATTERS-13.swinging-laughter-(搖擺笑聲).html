<h2>13.Swinging Laughter (搖擺笑聲)</h2><figure class="image"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/kDRCweMmqLnTPNlbum-pYA/prod/embed/c58f87e3-e44f-4cd3-be49-3677b7ad4564.jpeg/public" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Topic: 13.Swinging Laughter</h2><p>Yoga class notes: 40 Foundation Exercises</p><p>I first encountered "Laughter Yoga" through an online course recommended by a friend. To be honest, I felt a bit strange at first – laughing silly at the screen, could that really have any effect? But with a try-it-and-see attitude, I joined in.</p><p>In the course, the teacher led us in "Swinging Laughter." Even though it was online, everyone tried to simulate a large circle, imagining holding hands. The teacher demonstrated first, instructing us to make the long vowel sound "Ae...Ae...Aeeeee....." and then slowly move forward towards the screen, as if approaching the center of the circle.</p><p>The first time I did it, I felt a bit inhibited, my voice was soft, and my movements were stiff. But watching the other students on the screen, everyone was laughing happily, and I gradually relaxed. Following the teacher's guidance, we also tried different vowel sounds like "Eeee," "Eh... Eh... E..." and "Oh... Oh... O..."</p><p>The funniest part was when the teacher taught us a variation, asking us to imagine ourselves as a large group of people crowded together, not holding hands, raising our hands high, and laughing loudly at the sky. Even though it was just at the screen, the feeling of everyone going crazy together was really fun.</p><p>After a few practice sessions, I found that Laughter Yoga really can improve your mood. Even just online, through these simple movements and sounds, you can feel the energy of happiness. Now, I spend a little time doing Laughter Yoga every day, and I feel more energetic overall!</p><h2>13. 搖擺笑聲</h2><p>瑜珈課筆記：40個基礎練習</p><p>一開始接觸「大笑瑜珈」，是透過朋友介紹的線上課程。說實話，一開始覺得有點怪，對著螢幕傻笑，這能有什麼效果？但抱著試試看的心情，我還是加入了。</p><p>課程中，老師帶領我們做「搖擺大笑」（Swinging Laughter）。雖然是線上，大家還是盡量模擬一個大圓圈，想像彼此手牽著手。老師先示範，要我們發出長長的母音「Ae...Ae...Aeeeee.....」，然後慢慢地往螢幕前方移動，就像要靠近圓圈中心一樣。</p><p>第一次做的時候，我有點放不開，聲音小小的，動作也很僵硬。但看著螢幕上其他同學，大家都笑得很開心，我也漸漸放鬆了。隨著老師的引導，我們又嘗試了「Eeee」、「Eh... Eh... E...」和「Oh... Oh... O...」這些不同的母音。</p><p>最好笑的是，老師還教我們變化版，要我們想像自己是一大群人擠在一起，不用牽手，把手舉高高，對著天空大笑。雖然只是對著螢幕，但那種大家一起瘋狂的感覺，真的很有趣。</p><p>幾次練習下來，我發現大笑瑜珈真的能讓人心情變好。即使只是在線上，透過這些簡單的動作和聲音，也能感受到快樂的能量。現在，我每天都會花一點時間做大笑瑜珈，感覺整個人都更有活力了！</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.laughteryoga.org/">www.laughteryoga.org...</a></p><p><br class="smart"></p><p><strong>Laughter Yoga-Comic</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://laugh-yoga-hk.blogspot.com/">laugh-yoga-hk.blogsp...</a></p><p><strong>Laughter Yoga-Knowledge</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.notion.so/matterslab/by-1f3cfe24aa5280dfa056d06b7ca6fb3e">www.notion.so/matter...</a></p><p><strong>Find the best online laughter yoga for you!</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.laughteryoga.org/club/find-clubs-worldwide/">www.laughteryoga.org...</a></p><p><br class="smart"></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.tonkabean.me/">www.tonkabean.me/</a></p><p>Tonkabean</p><p>2025 June</p><p><br class="smart"></p>
